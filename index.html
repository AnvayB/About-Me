      I was born in Santa Cruz, CA in April 2000. We moved to Santa Clara, CA in 2001 and then to Milpitas, CA in 2002. I've lived in the same house for the past 19 years and consider Milpitas as my hometown. Some of my hobbies include photography and sleeping, both of which I want to improve upon this summer, as well as getting back into making mocktails, which I delved into in Summer 2020.

    <h4>Success Learning Center</h4>
    <p class = "content"> 
      My first job was at a tutoring center in Milpitas. My role was Student Tutor & Activities Supervisor. I taught students ranging from grades K - 8 a wide variety of topics, including algebra and intermediate grammar. On a more interesting note, I was also in charge of games – educational and recreational – which helped me bond better with the kids I was helping.

    <h4>RippleMatch</h4>
    <p class = "content">
      My first internship was at a company called RippleMatch, which specializes in finding qualified internship opportunities for students based on their profile. Its algorithm has a matching service where users enter their skills and preferences onto their profile and select which industries or companies they're interested in, and companies associated with RM would specify what qualities they are looking for in potential interns, so if both parties' interests overlapped, a match was made.
      Basically I was literally doing an internship where I would help other students find internships. It clearly wasn't a techincal internship, but it helped improve my confidence and communication skills when reaching out to students about the program.
