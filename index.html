      I was born in Santa Cruz, CA in April 2000. We moved to Santa Clara, CA in 2001 and then to Milpitas, CA in 2002. I've lived in the same house for the past 19 years and consider Milpitas as my hometown. <br>Some of my hobbies include photography and sleeping, both of which I want to improve upon this summer, as well as getting back into making mocktails, which I delved into in Summer 2020.
